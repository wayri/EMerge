""" DEMO 12: Mode Alignment

In some applications we wish to simulate transmission lines with multiple modes. In this
example we look at a circular waveguide with 4 ridges. The modal analysis performed to find
the modes are not guaranteed however to return each mode in order, nor in the right polarization
direction (+Z vs -Z). In EMerge we can alignm modes using the .align_mode() method.
